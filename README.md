# Instructions

You can use this project base or find a better suited one for your preferred framework e.g. react-starter, angular-webpack-starter or others.

You can re-use the HTML structure and SASS styles. On the CSS side, there is no framework used here, except for the normalize.css resets.

Install node version 5 to your machine, preferred way of doing this would be [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

1. Run `npm install` in the project root (i.e. folder where package.json file is)
2. `npm start` will start local node server that uses BrowserSync to reload any changes

You can access JSON under [http://localhost:3000/json/products.json](http://localhost:3000/json/products.json).

## Notes

This project is not complete, there are things that are done one-way, but could be done another way etc. Somethings might be incomplete.

Test(s) can be run with `npm run test`. Tests are located under ./test -folder. Name your tests as `_nameOfTest_.spec.js`. You can use any testing framework you like, but Mocha is preconfigured here.
